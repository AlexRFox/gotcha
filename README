To use this program you must have uvccapture installed. I found it
through apt. I don't know much about it, but it worked out of the box
for me. No setup required.

This program is designed to run in the background and take pictures
with a webcam when someone starts typing. The idea is that if someone
wonders over to your computer and starts typing things, you'll have a
picture of them. Odds are you'll wind up with a lot of pictures of
yourself.

The time interval is defined in the bottom of the for loop in
seconds. I have it set to 10 minutes (600 seconds) for now, I might
raise that if it tries to gobble up disk space too fast.

As an added bonus, the images get chmod 400. That makes it slightly
harder to accidentally delete the images, and if you're on a
multi-user system, it increases privacy a little.
